## Main Function for Testing

The main function is designed to test various functionalities of the Chicken class, including:
- Using the copy constructor.
- Using the assignment operator in a chained assignment (c2 = c3 = c;).
- Modifying c's name and printing the results to demonstrate that changes to one object do not affect other copies (proving deep copy functionality).
