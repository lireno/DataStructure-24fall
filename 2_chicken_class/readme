## Self-Assignment Issue
In line 36-38, the added condition `if (name == _name)` checks whether the `_name` is the same as the current name. If it is, the function returns immediately without deleting memory.
  ```c++
    void setName(const char* _name) {
        if (name == _name)
            return; // to prevent self-assignment

        if (name != nullptr)
            delete[] name;
            
        int len = strlen(_name) + 1;
        name = new char[len];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
            name[i] = _name[i];
    }
  ```
